# MysticNavigator

Minecraft Hub Plugin

## Getting Started

This Plugin allows you to set some GameModes up. Every GameMode has its Arenas and players can choose which arena they want to be teleported to.

### Dependencies

## Permissions and Commands

<Argument> is a must. [Argument] is optional.
```
/mn help : Display help
/mn add <GameMode> : Create a new GameMode 
/mn remove <GameMode> : Remove a GameMode (mn.remove)
/mn setspawn : Set the default spawn (Hub) (mn.setspawn)

```
	
## How-To

```
1. Set the default spawn (Hub).
2 Create a GameMode. (You can create more if you want, of course)
3 Give your players access to mn.join, mn.leave and mn.arenas
4 Add some arenas. (You have to add at least one Arena which will be set as the default Arena for the GameMode)
5 Lean back and relax. You are done.
